If even, it is divided by 2, if odd it is multiplied by three and then 1 is added. The brackets are used to avoid any confusion in the order of the operations. The iteration of the number through each outcome of the if else statement within the function is completed by the next piece of code. "

    "This section of code was also taken from the course content and modified to work for the task. It is a function that contains a while loop. The function 'collatz' runs as long as x is not equal to 1 -> the end of the Collatz sequence where the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2,... continues indefinitely. Stopping at one shows that it does in fact get to one, but prevents the indefinite loop. It then prints the variable 'x', and adds a comma and a space to the end of the output 'x' value. 'x' is then defined as the previous function, 'f(x)'. This applies the function, and therefore the collatz rules to the current 'x' value. After the loop is completed (i.e. when x is equal to one), it prints the final 'x' value (1) without the comma and space. "
